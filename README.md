**A library (and hopefully a set of models) for running ML based compression models specifically for images (to start with).**

## Why?

Because why not?!

But more realistically, legacy compression engines have theoretical limits on compression, our goal is to push the boundaries of image compression by exploring novel ML-based approaches and providing robust benchmarking tools for comparative analysis.

## Included Contents

### Benchmarking Library (WIP)
A robust framework for evaluating and comparing different compression algorithms across various metrics including:
- Compression ratio
- Visual quality (PSNR, SSIM)
- Processing time
- Memory usage

### ML Compression Engine (WIP)
Machine learning models specifically designed for image compression, featuring:
- Neural network architectures optimized for compression tasks

## Roadmap

- [ ] Complete benchmarking framework
- [ ] Implement baseline ML compression models
- [ ] Add support for video compression
